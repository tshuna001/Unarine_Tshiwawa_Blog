Welcome to Unarine's page.



I am currently holding Masters degree in Astrophysics, under the University of the Western Cape.  My research has been chiefly focused on analysing, modelling, and interpret large Astrophysical datasets (HI datacubes) for physical meanings.  I have a strong background in Physics and Astrophysics, Computational Math and Math Modelling.  My inquisitiveness and passion for Science and Technology inspired my decision to obtain degrees in Physics & Chemistry,  Astrophysics & Space Science from which I have gained strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

In addition to my tertiary qualifications and self-studying work, I am developing and sharpening my technical skills in machine learning and deep learning significantly.  My enthusiast and developments in machine learning, deep learning and broader data science and fields of science, technology, engineering and math have driven me to constantly be alongside with recent developments in Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).
